</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>All CTF projects are to be submitted via <a href="https://d2l.pdx.edu/"> D2L dropbox (d2l.pdx.edu)</a></h2>

<h3>Submission requirements:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create a directory that names your level.  Use the notation followed by current levels, but add your own OdinID at the end of it.  Specifically, the name should have the format: Chapter_LevelName_OdinID.   For example:
		<pre>Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang</pre>

	<li>Include in this directory, your	C source code (program.c.template), build script (build.zsh), and any supporting files
		for your level.   Do not include any binaries or non-necessary files with your submissions.</li>

	<li>As with the original source, ensure the build script takes an arbitrary number of usernames and builds polymorphic binaries in the obj/username directory.  Each binary has the same name which is the name given to the level above.</li>

	<li>When complete, create a zip file of the level directory.  For example, if the level directory is /u/wuchang/Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang , then:
		<pre>
	mashimaro <~> % ls Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang
        build.zsh  program.c.template
        mashimaro <~> % cd /u/wuchang
        mashimaro <~> % zip -r Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang.zip Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang
  	adding: Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang/ (stored 90%)
 	adding: Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang/program.c.template (stored 91%)
  	adding: Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang/build.zsh (stored 90%)
  	mashimaro <~> % ls
        Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang/  Ch08Dbg_GdbIntro_wuchang.zip
  	mashimaro <~> % 
		</pre>

      Then, upload the zip file to the D2L dropbox.

	<li>IMPORTANT: Re-download your submission from D2L as soon as you submit to ensure it has been properly received.
