1.  Learning objective
How focused is the learning objective of the challenge?
Does it address a core concept from the course?
What is the value of the pedagogy?

2.  Creativity
Does the assignment use a novel technique or teach a new topic?

3.  Code
What is the quantity of functionality within the code?  What is the
quality of the code?  Does the code force the student to apply
a targeted concept in order to solve?  Does the code generate metamorphic
binaries?

4.  Difficulty
Is the description sufficiently clear so that the level can be solved
in under 60 minutes?

5.  Format
Does the level meet the formating guidelines?  Does the level follow the
naming convention that includes the chapter it is derived from and a
descriptive name of the concept it is teaching?  Does the build.zsh script
take a list of usernames and build a 32-bit binary for each within
the directory obj/<username> as the template does?

6.  Walkthrough
Does the screencast explain the level's learning objective and walk-through its code thoroughly? Does the screencast perform a demonstration of the steps required by someone to solve the level using the intended method?
